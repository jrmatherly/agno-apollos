description: "Multi-step pipelines that chain agents together for automated processing."
---

Workflows chain agents into sequential steps. Each step's output feeds into the next, producing structured results from multi-stage processing.

```python
from agno.workflow import Workflow
from agno.workflow.step import Step

from backend.agents.reasoning_agent import reasoning_agent
from backend.agents.web_search_agent import web_search_agent

research_workflow = Workflow(
    id="research-workflow",
    name="Research Workflow",
    description="Search the web for a topic, then analyze and synthesize findings.",
    steps=[
        Step(
            name="Web Research",
            description="Search the web for information on the given topic.",
            agent=web_search_agent,
        ),
        Step(
            name="Analysis & Synthesis",
            description="Analyze the research findings and produce a structured report.",
            agent=reasoning_agent,
        ),
    ],
)
```

## Research Workflow

The built-in Research Workflow runs two steps sequentially:

| Step | Agent | Purpose |
|------|-------|---------|
| 1. Web Research | Web Search Agent | Gathers information from the web |
| 2. Analysis & Synthesis | Reasoning Agent | Analyzes findings and produces a structured report |

The web search agent collects sources with citations, then the reasoning agent synthesizes the findings into a coherent analysis.

## Teams vs workflows

| Aspect | Teams | Workflows |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| Execution | Dynamic delegation by a coordinator | Fixed sequential steps |
| Control | Leader decides which member handles what | Steps always run in order |
| Use case | Open-ended research, complex queries | Repeatable pipelines with known stages |

Use teams when the task requires adaptive delegation. Use workflows when the processing stages are fixed and predictable.

## Workflow registration

Workflows are registered in `backend/main.py` alongside agents and teams:

```python
from backend.workflows.research_workflow import research_workflow

agent_os = AgentOS(
    # ...
    workflows=[research_workflow],
)
```

## Creating a workflow

1. Create a file in `backend/workflows/`
2. Define `Step` instances with an `agent` for each stage
3. Combine steps into a `Workflow`
4. Register in `backend/main.py`

See the [Agno Workflows docs](https://docs.agno.com/workflows/introduction) for advanced features like conditional steps and parallel execution.
