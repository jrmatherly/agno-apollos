Teams combine multiple agents under a coordinator that delegates subtasks and synthesizes results.

```python
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.team import Team
from agno.team.team import TeamMode
from agno.tools.reasoning import ReasoningTools
from agno.tools.websearch import WebSearchTools

from backend.db import get_postgres_db
from backend.models import get_model

web_researcher = Agent(
    name="Web Researcher",
    role="Search the web for current information",
    model=get_model(),
    tools=[WebSearchTools(enable_search=True, enable_news=True)],
    instructions=[
        "Search the web to find relevant, current information.",
        "Always cite sources with URLs.",
        "Provide concise, factual summaries.",
    ],
    markdown=True,
)

analyst = Agent(
    name="Analyst",
    role="Analyze information and synthesize findings",
    model=get_model(),
    instructions=[
        "Analyze the information provided by team members.",
        "Identify patterns, contradictions, and gaps.",
        "Provide structured analysis with clear conclusions.",
        "Use the think tool for complex multi-step reasoning.",
    ],
    markdown=True,
)

research_team = Team(
    name="Research Team",
    id="research-team",
    mode=TeamMode.coordinate,
    model=get_model(),
    db=get_postgres_db(),
    members=[web_researcher, analyst],
    tools=[ReasoningTools(add_instructions=True)],
    instructions=[
        "You lead a research team with a web researcher and an analyst.",
        "For factual questions, delegate to the Web Researcher.",
        "For analysis and synthesis, delegate to the Analyst.",
        "For complex questions, have the Researcher gather data, then the Analyst synthesize.",
        "Always provide a final, consolidated answer.",
    ],
    markdown=True,
    compress_tool_results=True,
    max_iterations=5,
    store_history_messages=True,

## Research Team

The built-in Research Team coordinates two specialized agents:

| Member | Role | Tools |
|--------|------|-------|
| Web Researcher | Searches the web for current information | `WebSearchTools` (search + news) |
| Analyst | Analyzes and synthesizes findings | None (reasoning via instructions) |

The team leader uses `ReasoningTools` for complex multi-step delegation and `TeamMode.coordinate` to route subtasks to the appropriate member.

## Key features

| Feature | Configuration |
|---------|---------------|
| Coordination mode | `TeamMode.coordinate` routes tasks to members |
| Shared memory | `share_member_interactions=True` for cross-member context |
| History | `store_history_messages=True` persists team conversations |
| History depth | `num_history_runs=5` controls context window for team history |
| Iteration cap | `max_iterations=5` prevents runaway coordination loops |
| Reasoning | `ReasoningTools(add_instructions=True)` for the coordinator |
| Compression | `compress_tool_results=True` reduces token usage |
| Datetime context | `add_datetime_to_context=True` provides temporal awareness |
| Session memory | `db=get_postgres_db()` persists across sessions |

## Team modes

Agno supports multiple team coordination modes:

| Mode | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `TeamMode.coordinate` | Leader delegates subtasks to specific members |
| `TeamMode.collaborate` | Members work together on the same task |
| `TeamMode.route` | Leader routes the full task to one member |

See the [Agno Teams docs](https://docs.agno.com/teams/introduction) for all coordination modes.
